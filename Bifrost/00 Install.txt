	Installation, really very simple :

		.	First of all you have to install the setup of the framework, in the folder "01 Framework"
			you will find the download link but also the setup already downloaded, start "vc_redist.x86.exe",
			at the end if we notice that something is wrong in Metatrader then we will also install "vc_redist.x64.exe"

		.	In the folder "02 cTrader" you will find the two executable files for the cTrader run both files
			double-click on "Bifrost Copyer.algo" and "Bifrost Provider.algo".

		.	In the folder "03 Metatrader 4" you will find the folder "MQL4" that will have to be copied and pasted into the
			path of your Metatrader 4 installation, to know the right path you must open the MT4 Terminal
			and in File --> Open Data Folder --> Paste the folder MQL4 and all the files will be correctly positioned.

		.	In the folder "04 Metatrader 5" you will find files similar to those of MT4, do the same procedure with the folder
			MQL5
